INTRODUCTION

Scheduler.py is a current work in process project, meant to generate a weekly schedule for employees' who work in shifts. 

REQUIREMENTS

The following files MUST be contained in the same directory when running the program:
* dictGenerator.py
* Person.py
* scheduler.py (This is the main file)
* Any text files used as input to the scheduler

INCLUDED FILES

* dictGenerator.py
* Person.py
* scheduler.py
* testInput
* testInputTwo


RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS

* Currently, this program can only be run from the command line. To run the program, use the command: python3 scheduler.py
* When prompted, enter an input file name, two test input files are included in this repository. 
* If the input files do not contain settings for the schedule, the user will be prompted for this information on the command line. 
* The weekly schedule, along with warnings about unfilled positions, will be printed to the standard output

CURRENT VERSION NOTES
* This is an ongoing work in progress, this is why there are no comments, coding 
standards are not yet strictly adhered to, efficiency is not optimal, and not all edge cases have been 
accounted for. To see examples of projects which have the aforementioned attributes, please see the other 
repositories in my GitHub, under my username KatrinaGW. 
* Plans for future functionality include: multiple shifts of varying lengths, wages and payroll, optional overtime.
